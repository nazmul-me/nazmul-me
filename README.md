## Hi there 👋 

I am Md **Nazmul** Haque, a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://csc.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://ncsu.edu/), advised by [Laurie Williams](https://lauriew.github.io/) in the [RealSearch Lab](https://realsearchgroup.github.io/). Before that, I have recieved my B.Sc and M.Sc in Software Engineering from the [Institute of Information Technology (IIT)](https://iit.du.ac.bd/), [University of Dhaka](https://du.ac.bd/), supervised by [Dr. Mohammad Shoyaib](https://iit.du.ac.bd/about_iit/individual_teacher/48). My research focuses on the intersection of Software Security and Machine Learning (ML), specifically software supply chain security, AI security, and privacy.


I have professional experience as a **Software Engineer** at [Samsung R & D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/srbd), Bangladesh, and as a **Software Engineer Intern** at [Datasoft Systems Bangladesh Limited](https://www.datasoft-bd.com). 
<!-- I am an Assistant Professor at the CSE department, [Islamic University of Technology](https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/nazmulhaque/), Bangladesh, a subsidiary organ of OIC since April 2023. Currently, I am on study leave to pursue a Ph.D. Prior to this, I served as a Lecturer in the same department from July 2021. -->
